This Demo represents how ConstraintLayout works and how one can use it to build responsive UIs.

This ConstraintLayout demo is created to help user to understand how tools provided by ConstraintLayout (guidelines, constraints,etc) 
can be used to create UI without using view hierarchies.

The demo includes a similar UI screen of an app from Google Playstore that is made using features of ConstraintLayout.
